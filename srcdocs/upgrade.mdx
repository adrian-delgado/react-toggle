# Upgrade from previous version

## Upgrade from 1.x version

This version is not fully compatible with the previous 1.x versions. Anyway, you may update your code easly

## Labels

First of all, we've removed the embeded labels. In the previous version you had

```jsx
<Toggle label="Left label" />
```

Now you may use the following for the left label

```jsx
<label htmlFor="toggle-a">
  Click me
  <Toggle name="toggle-a" />
</label>
```

And the following code for the right label

```jsx
<label htmlFor="toggle-b">
  <Toggle name="toggle-b" />
  Click me
</label>
```

## Events

The previous `onChange` event become `onToggle`

```jsx
  <Toggle name="toggle-c" onToggle={e => console.log(e.target.checked)} />
```

The new `onToggle` event, has got only one param, I mean, the standard `event` object.
In fact, you will be able to get all information about the toggle by using `e.target` as shown above.

In addition, you may use the new `onRight` event. It's trigged when the toggle is switched from the left to the right. In short, when it's **on** (usually).

```jsx
  <Toggle name="toggle-c" onRight={e => console.log(e.target.name)} />
```

Of course, there is also the `onLeft` event. It's trigged when the toggle is switched from the right to the left. In short, when it's **off** (usually).

```jsx
  <Toggle name="toggle-c" onLeft={e => console.log(e.target.name)} />
```

## Mode prop

The props `mode` is no longer available. This because in the previous version the `mode="switch"` was keeping the "on" and "off" appearance colours the same. Now, you can do the same by using the new props `backgroundColor` and `backgroundColorRight`, as well as `color` and `colorRight`.

## Theme prop

We have removed the `theme` prop as well. Now, you'll be able to create any toggle by using the new props for the appearance and the theme provider.
